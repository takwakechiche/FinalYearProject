===============================================

OptorSim is a Grid simulation tool written by the EU DataGrid for the
purpose of testing replication algorithms.  This file describes the
contents of the package.  More detailed documentation can be found in
the userguide and javadoc in the doc/ directory. More information can
also be found on the OptorSim webpage:

Brief History
-------------

2.1 - Bug fixes since 2.0. Slightly more sophisticated file processing / job 
      execution model.

2.0 - New event-driven time model adopted and completely new GUI, plus bug fixes 
      since 1.0.1.

1.0.1 - Bug fix release to fix bugs associated with file pinning and 
	ResourceBroker.

1.0 - Large refactoring of the code to make it more modular and easy
      to expand. Auction code separated into auctions package. GridTime
      is used instead of system time. Many more areas cleaned up.

0.6 - Mainly bug fixes, internal release used for benchmark
      results in Grid2003 paper.

0.5.5 - A new interrupt style for file transfers and background
        network traffic have been added. Last version before major
        restructuring.

0.5 - All packages moved to edg-optorsim. Much added functionality 
      including auctionsim package and improved scheduling. Many new
      features have been added to the GUI.

0.4 - Many bugs removed.  More comprehensive histograms produced.  Many
      improvements to the user interface.

0.3 - (Meta-stable release)  This tag was made before the auctionsim was
      incorporated.  Economic model optimiser added.

0.2 - EU DataGrid architecture adopted.  Replica manager added
      allowing the construction of basic replica optimisers.

0.1 - Initial conception of the project.  Very basic infrastructure
      present.  No replication possible.
