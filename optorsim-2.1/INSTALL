= OptorSim - Intstallation and Build Instructions =
===================================================

These instructions describe how to install OptorSim.  Two forms are
available: The source distribution comes with the source code and must
be compiled to install it. The pre-built distribution does not include
the source code but is pre-compiled and is ready to run.

Software Dependencies
---------------------

    * Java(TM) 2 SDK: Version 1.4.0 or greater
    * ant: Version 1.5.0 or greater (to re-build the code after any
            changes or to run functional tests)

Standard Build
--------------

The tarball of the most recent version of the code can be downloaded
from the OptorSim website:

http://cern.ch/edg-wp2/optimization/optorsim.html

Start by unpacking the tarball

 $ tar xvfz optorsim-2.1.tar.gz

or use an archiving package such as WinZip (do not open the file
directly from the browser but save it to disk first and then open it.)

Change directory to optorsim-2.1/

 $ cd optorsim-2.1/

Set the user path to contain the bin/ directory.  This contains the
executables to run optorsim and scripts for histogram
analysis. e.g. for Bash shells

 $ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin

for csh/tcsh:

 $ set path = ($path $PWD/bin)

Optorsim is now ready to run! For \texttt{UNIX} users, there is a
suite of functional tests available which test the main components of
the simulation to check everything is working properly. These can be
run using \texttt{ant} and are best run on an unloaded computer:

 $ ant func-test

If the source code is modified, it can be recompiled using ant:

 $ ant

The JavaDoc can also be compiled with:

 $ ant doc

The resulting html pages are in the doc/api directory.
