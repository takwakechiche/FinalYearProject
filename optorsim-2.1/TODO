= OptorSim - To do ============================
===============================================

*) add job budgets, i.e. AM bids with upper price limit. Currently AM
   is price taker and SB are price setters.

*) Model different kinds of jobs for example Monte-Carlo jobs and have
   new files added to the Grid as the simulation runs.

*) Better modelling of CEs with worker nodes etc.

*) Dynamic Grid where not all resources (CEs, etc) are always available.

TODO on the GUI
===============

*) Make parameters modifiable from GUI so simulation can be
   restarted with different params.
   
*) Facility to add/remove sites on the Grid using GUI and change
   resources available.
