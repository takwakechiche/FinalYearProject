Some bugs and open questions yet to be resolved.


BUGS - unpredictable errors.

1. Future file value evaluation - probabilities too low and where to
put it.



QUICK FIXES - dirty hacks that need fixing

None currently known...



UNWANTED FEATURES - not really errors but we'd rather they weren't
there

1. File sizes must all be the same if auctions are being used.

2. All network connections use the same fraction of bandwidth no
matter what the bottleneck is eg

 ---------||---------
   10Mb       500Mb

If a file is transfered along this link the available bandwidth for
another transfer across the 500Mb link is 250Mb and not 490Mb.



OPEN ISSUES - questions needing answers

1. What do we do when there is no winner of a top level auction - can
the job continue and be successful without one of the files it
requires?

2. How do we handle more than one CE on a site? Should they have
separate queues or be treated as one entity?

3. How do we handle more than one SB per site? Can two have/ bid for
the same file?
